# sorting algorithm :

# 1>comparision  based -- selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, heap sort
# 2> non comparison based -- count sort , Radix sort , bucket sort 

# optimised :
# 1.space complexity
# 2.time complexity

# Stability  in sorting algorithms:

# stable >> relative order should be maintained after sorting algorithm

#             dictionary(key,value) >> (hashing  data structure) sorting base on keys
#             (4,2)(5,7)(4,3)(6,8)(7,10)
#             after sorting
#             (4,2) (5,7) (4,3) (6,8) (7,10) or (4,3) (4,2) (5,7) (6,8) (7,10)  >> which is stable
#             stable(relative order is maintained)    unstable (relative order not maintained) (4 ,3) comes before (4,2)

# unstable sort >>          1 . quick sort
# 2 . selection sort
# 3. heap sort

# placed >> 1.inplace>>not using any extra space to sort an array
#           2.outplace>> using  extra space to sort the array....>> optimised sometime take less time complexity
#             example  : merge sort(devine and concour)


# bubble sort >> [70,20,50,30,90,5,15]
# n=7
